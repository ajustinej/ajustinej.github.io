    <h1>About Me</h1>

</a>

<p> Welcome to my personal website! I'm Justine, former machine learning / software engineer and aspiring lawyer living in New
York City. I am interested in a wide spectrum of fields within public interest
law, most notably privacy, AI regulation/ethics, 
anti-trust, labor rights anti-discrimination. Please reach out if you have an opportunity that you think I would
be interested in!</p>


<h2>Background</h2>

<p>I graduated from <a href="https://www.mit.edu" target="_blank">MIT</a> with a double
major in Computer Science and Mathematics in 2017. My first job was working as
a machine learning engineer at <a
  href="https://www.cerebras.ai/" target="_blank">Cerebras</a>. After
that I worked as a fullstack engineer at the Demographic Data Engineering team
at <a href="https://www.indeed.com/esg/demographic-data" target="_blank">Indeed</a>.
</p>

<p>
I left Indeed in November and have been volunteering, working on a variety of
personal projects, and self-reflecting. I have been
accepted to <a href="https://www.law.nyu.edu/" target="_blank">NYU Law School</a> and am slated to begin in Fall 2026.
In the meantime, I am looking for positions at the intersection of tech and legal, such as policy or paralegal positions. I am
also open to freelancing work.</p>

<p>You can find my <a href="/assets/pdfs/resume.pdf" target="_blank">resume here</a>.
